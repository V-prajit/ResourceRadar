# Placeholder for Screenshots

Replace `dashboard_screenshot.png` and `detailed_metrics.png` with actual screenshots of your application.

## Instructions for Taking Good Screenshots

1. **Dashboard Screenshot**:
   - Use the testing environment to create 10 test systems
   - Run the stress test script to generate interesting metrics
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for metrics to show variation
   - Use dark mode for a professional look
   - Take a screenshot showing all systems in the dashboard view

2. **Detailed Metrics Screenshot**:
   - Click on one of the systems to view detailed metrics
   - Select a 15m or 1h time range to show good variation
   - Ensure both CPU and memory graphs are visible
   - Capture the entire detailed view including the back button and time selector

3. **Image Specifications**:
   - Save both images in PNG format
   - Place them in this `docs` directory
   - Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Crop to remove any unnecessary browser UI
